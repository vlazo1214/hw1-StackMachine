# hw1-StackMachine

What we submit:

- `sources.txt`: *lists the names of all the .c files needed to compile
  your program, all on one line separated by spaces.*
  
  - For example, if you have files named base.c, instruction.c, and vm.c, then your file sources.txt would look contain (only) the following line of text naming these files:
    
  
                                              `base.c instruction.c vm.c`
  
- `.h` files (header files)
  
- *The output of a test program running in the virtual machine. Please provide a copy of the initial state of the stack and the state of stack after the execution of each instruction. Please see the example in Appendix B.*
  

We will take some points off for:

- code that does not work properly,
  
- duplicated code,
  
- code with extra unnecessary cases, or
  
- code that is excessively hard to follow.
